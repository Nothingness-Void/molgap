# PCQM Gap Architecture Screen Status

- No molecular-research-server access is authorized during architecture
  selection.
- No official PCQM4Mv2 validation or test-dev row is authorized during the
  Kaggle screen.
- Kaggle2 CPU kernel
  `kaseichou/molgap-official-pcqm-gap100k-r1-prep`, version 1, completed with
  a retained acceptance failure because RDKit was absent; its output and log
  remain under `platforms/_records/kaggle/training/pcqm_gap100k_r1_prep_v1`.
- Version 2 included the infrastructure-only fix `rdkit==2025.3.5`, but
  stopped after 65,000 training graphs when a valid bondless molecule
  reached an empty edge-feature range reduction. Its output and log remain
  under `platforms/_records/kaggle/training/pcqm_gap100k_r1_prep_v2`.
- Source commit `e8b190320af98834c9f85f5911d038ac196d1b5b` preserves bondless
  molecules, skips only their empty bond-range reduction, and records their
  count. Version 3 uses this fix with the otherwise unchanged contract.
- A GPU screen may start only after that cache passes local no-inference
  acceptance.

The GPU seed-42 screen is staged but not submitted. Task order remains
authoritative in `ROADMAP.md`; retrieval hashes will be added only after local
no-inference acceptance.
